The Internet: "Network of Networks" 
World Wide Web (WWW):  www is like a virtual directory or a place where websites/digital documents      reside. Also, it gives us the way to access those websites/document by using "PROTOCOLS".

Protocols: Rules for communication over the www. WWW is not Internet! And Internet is not WWW.

HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol: http://    https:// [secure]
URL: Uniform Resource Locator! Address of a website

Port:   http:// 80
        https:// 443
 In general, the computer has 65535 ports..

Protocol + domain + port  = origin
