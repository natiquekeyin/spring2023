Block Level and Inline Elements:
Block level that occupy a block and don't allow anything to run after them...
Inline elements become part of the line where they are used.. and allow contents on either side ofthem...

Generic Containers:
<div>...</div> block level container
<span>...</span> inline level container

All semantic elements like <header></header>, <main></main>..<footer></footer> WILL ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS GO inside <body> element NEVER OUTSIDE OF IT.....
