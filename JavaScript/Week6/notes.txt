REACT:

    1)MEAN[MongoDB ExpressJS AngularJS NodeJS]
    2)MERN[MongoDB ExpressJS ReactJS NodeJS]

    MongoDB: is the database part, that can store all the related data of a web application

    ExpressJS: is responsible for settting up the "servers"..i)Static Website, ii)Dynamic Websites...
        i)static websites: That show same content to every user ...HTML,CSS,JS ...www.myresume.com[index.html,style.css]...that will always show my static page that contains my resume.."client side scripts"
        ii) dynamic websites: that show different contents to different users...Weather website...Hockey game 0 1 ...2 3...facebook.com.. if enter my user name and id .. I will get my feeds..[ASP.net,PHP,JSP(Java Server Pages) were server side technologies.."JAVASCRIPT"]
        "server side script".. EXPRESS JS...
    NodeJS: is the runtime that allows JavaScript do wonders...
        that enables JS to run NOT ONLY on client side BUT ALSO on servers as well on Console Based applications...[JS was primarily ONLY client side scripting language when it was born..with "NODEJS", first we got the ability to use JS to create Servers...] [JS was primarily ONLY FOR web development, BUT NodeJS enable JS to work on "Console Based" applicaitons... means desktop based applications...]

    A front-end library that enables developers to create HIGHLY responsive and intuitive User Interfaces(UIs) suitable for all types of devices.
    SPA: Single Page Applications:We only have one page in React app..."index.html"... 
    Components: Are reusable elements that can load themselves with new contents WITHOUT requesting servers over and over....

NEVER SEND NODE_MODULES FOLDER TO ME IN ANY SUBMISSION...

Lecture June 6,2023:

NEVER FORGET TO SEND "package.json" IN YOUR SUBMISSION...
THIS "package.json" file is used to install or get access to all libraries and files that we need to run a project with...

1. public/index.html:
    This is the "SP" that runs when a react application runs...
    It only has <div id="root"> </div>....and everythingn that we see is somehow injected here....
2. src/index.js:
    This is a file that takes hold of "root" area of index.html and creates a root element in ReactDOM[a virtual DOM that react creates for its applications...] and renders the "<App/> ... COMPONENT".. into that area...
3. src/App.js:
    App is a "component".. a very important or "main" component that runs when react applciation runs....

N.B: Every component should start with a capital letter..

Components:
    Reusable areas that can be loaded with different data..without requesting the server...
    App is the main component in react applciations...
    We can make our own components are run insdie App component...

    ALL Components return "JSX" which is a combination of "HTML","CSS" and "JAVASCRIPT"...

    They are just like normal functions, BUT they return JSX...

    JSX is the combination of HTML,CSS and JavaScript...
    Types of Components:
        1.Class Components
        2.Function Components.


Function Components:

import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  var fname = "Alan";
  var age = 20;
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>My First Application - {fname.toUpperCase()}</h1>
      <p>React is fun to learn!!!!and you are {age} years old!!</p>
    </div>
  );
  // the above all is "jsx.."
}

export default App;


Fragments in React:
<> </>
This is called fragment in react.. it wraps around all the "JSX" to make it in one container...THEY DONOT PRODUCE ANY CODE...

SO, the jsx should be wrapped in a single container..be it a <div></div> OR a fragment....

Lecture June 7,2023 Part 1

Making our own components:
After making component, we first import it at the top, and then we can call it with element like syntax like <Header/>..

props (properties):
    are like arguments to the functions...
    They are passed to the components and components receive them and use the values...

    abc(a,b) a, b are called parameters..
    abc(4,5) -> 


    Ways to access props:
    1) 
    function Header(props) {
  var t = props.title;
  var b = props.body;
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <p>{t}</p>
        <h1>Header</h1>
        <p>I am Header Component- {b}</p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default Header;

2) 
function Header(props) {
  var { title, body } = props;
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <p>{title}</p>
        <h1>Header</h1>
        <p>I am Header Component- {body}</p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

3)

function Header({ title, body }) {
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <p>{title}</p>
        <h1>Header</h1>
        <p>I am Header Component- {body}</p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default Header;

DEFAULT PROPS:
In case if no props are passed, we use defaultProps to fill in the place of props...

PART 2 - JUNE 7

.isRequired with props make them compulsory to be sent by the calling party...

Apply Styling to the elements:
use this syntax:

<h1 style={{backgroundColor:'black'}}>
</h1>

In normal CSS we have 
background-color:'black';


Lecture of June 8:

npm: node package manager...

Let's create a component "Button"...why? because we can pass the text and color for different options and it will display button accordingly...

Events:
onClick();

WHAT ARE CLASS COMPONENTS?

Class components are like function components with following properties...
Each class component is actually a child of "Component"[a default parent class defined in react for creating child compoents..].. the class component has a render() method that actually returns the JSX code....

The class component has something called "State"....by state we mean... the values in variables of the class at a particular time...

state variables can be defined in the constructor of the class after calling super() constructor of "Component" class...Next week..discuss!

Lecture of June 12,2023:

Hooks in React:

Hooks in function components are what state variables are in class component...
Hooks are the way to mantain data ("state") of a function component...

Hooks are the "proper" way of defining variables in a function component...

What is a Hook?
Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.

1. useState() hook:
  defines a state variable, and provides us a function to change/update the state variable...
   i)import {useState} from "react";
  ii) const [x, setX] = useState(0); // useState defines a variable "x" and sets up the value given as a parameter as the default valure of the variable and also returns a function "setX" that can be used to change/udpate the value of "x"....

  Initialize useState
We initialize our state by calling useState in our function component.

useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:

The current state.
A function that updates the state.

const[x,setX] = useState(0);

<h2>{x}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setX(x + 1)}>Increment X</button>

<h2>
        {myArray[0]} - {name}
      </h2>
      <button onClick={() => myArray[1]("Bob")}> Change</button>
      <button onClick={() => setName("Christina")}> Change Name</button>


      const [num, setNum] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState("John");

  let changeState = () => {
    setName("David");
  };

  let changeNum = () => {
    setNum(num + 1);
  };


  <h3>{name}</h3>
      <button onClick={changeState}>Update</button>
      <p>You clicked the change button {num} times</p>
      <button onClick={changeNum}>Change</button>


      const[person,setPerson]=useState({name:"Alan",age:23...})

      ... spread operator:

      ...previousState means... spread or read all the state values which are available...
      return{
        ...previousState,name:"Bob"
      }


Lecture June 13,2023:

States can be maintained in any of the components by using "Redux"...(NOT IN OUR DISCUSSION)

Let's use some ICONS... React-icons...
