AJAX:
Promises?
XMLHTTPRequest?
Fetch API...?
Async/Await...?

ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT:

We want that our main working/screens/UI should not be effected while there is some intensive processing going on...

Sometimes we want to wait until some background intensive processing is happening before going to the next step..

XmlHttpRequest(XHR) Object
    API in the form of an object..
    Provided by the browsers...
    Methods to transfer data between client /servers..
    All communication in background..withou "REQUESTING" server over and over...
    Work with data other then XML (JSON, plain text)...
API (application programming interfaces) that provide some end points where we can go and read data from...


Promises in JavaScript:
 If I promise to take a review session on Friday.
 There are two possibilities...
    i)I take the session (promise fulfilled)
    ii) I don't take the session (promise rejected)

In JS, a promise is a special statement that is either "resolve" or "reject"...

Another way of solving asynchronous issue is by using "Callback functions"...
Same problem with promises...
