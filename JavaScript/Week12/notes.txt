Assertions:When writing tests, we often need to check that values meet certain conditions.. assertions decide if a test passes or fails..

expect()... assertion..
The argument should be the value that your code produces...
Typically, you will use expect with a "matcher" function to assert somethign about a value...
A matcher can optionally accept an argument which is the expected value...

expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();


WHAT TO TEST?
    Test component renders
    Test compnent renders with props
    Test component renders in different states
    Test component reacts to events...

WHAT NOT TO TEST?
    Implementation details..
    Third pary code.
    Code that is not important from a user point of view...

RTL Queries:[querySelector, getElementByID in DOM in HTML??]
 Every test we write generally involves the followiong basic steps:
    i)Render the component
    ii) Find an elment rendered by the compnent..
    iii) Assert against the element found in step 2 which will pass or fail the test...

    Queries are the methnods that Testing Libray provides to find elements on the page...
    To find a single element on the page, 
        i) getBy..
        ii)queryBy..
        ii)findBy..
    To find multiple elements on the page, 
        i)getAllBy..
        ii)queryAllBy..
        iii)findAllBy..

        .. represent the subffix that can be one of the Role,LabelText,PlaceHolderText,Text,DisplayValue,AltText,Title and TestId.

        getByText() we have used this one a lot...
    
    getByRole()
        it queries for elements with the given role..

        Role refers to the ARIA(Accessible Rich Internet Applications) role which provides semantic meaning to the content to ensure people using assistive technologies are able to use them....

        By default many semantic element sin HTML have a role...
        
        Button element has a "button" role.
        anchor elmeent has a "link" role.
        h1 to h6 have a "heading" role...
        checkboxes have a "checkbox" role..
        radio buttons have a "radio" role...

        <a role="button">... any element if we add this... button role is attached that particular element....
