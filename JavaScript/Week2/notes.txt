Week2 notes! JavaScript 

DOM PROGRAMMING:

HTML -> DOM <- JS!

DOM: Document Object Model

is an API (Application Programming Interface) [ a piece of software that enables different softwares to talk to each other]

DOM is an API that enables HTML to talk to JS and vice versa![HTML & JS Communcation!]

Valid HTML Document?

DOM Tree:
The html document is represented as an upside down tree (DOM_TREE.jpg). The top NODE is called "root element" and rest all nodes are childs of root node... 
In DOM Tree every element of HTML represent one "NODE" ...
And the text section inside nodes is called "Text Node"....

SO, document is the main object that deals with the "DOM tree" and enables us to manipulate the different elements of our html document.

var myTitle = document.title;

This will define a variable "myTitle" and store the current title of the document inside it....

Programming the DOM:

Web pages are dynamic:they can change in response to user actions, different data, JavaScript code etc.
Where HTML defines the initial structure of the page, the DOM is the current or actual content of the page as its exists right now in browser...

The DOM is a programming interface(ie. set of Objects, fucntions, properties) allowing scripts to interact with and modify documents (html). 

Strings in JavaScript:

"hello" ...
'hello' ...
`hello` ...
